# Installing Go server on Linux

<!-- toc -->

Installation of the go server using the package manager will require root access on the machine. You are also required to have a java version 7 for the server to run.

The installer will create a user called ```go``` if one does not exist on the machine. The home directory will be set to ```/var/go```. If you want to create your own ```go``` user, make sure you do it before you install the Go server.

## RPM based distributions (ie RedHat/CentOS/Fedora)

The Go server RPM installer has been tested on RedHat Enterprise Linux and CentOS. It should work on most RPM based Linux distributions.

If you prefer to use the YUM repository and install via YUM -

``` bash
$ echo "
[gocd]
name            = GoCD YUM Repository
baseurl         = http://dl.bintray.com/gocd/gocd-rpm
enabled         = 1
gpgcheck        = 0
" > /etc/yum.repos.d/thoughtworks-go.repo

$ yum install -y java-1.7.0-openjdk #optional, you may use other jre/jdk if you prefer
$ yum install -y go-server
```

Alternatively, if you have the server RPM downloaded -

``` bash
$ yum install -y java-1.7.0-openjdk #optional, you may use other jre/jdk if you prefer
$ rpm -i go-server-${version}.noarch.rpm
```

## Debian based distributions (ie Ubuntu)

The Go server .deb installer has been tested on Ubuntu. However it should work on most Linux distributions which use debs.

If you prefer to use the apt repository and install via `apt-get` -

```bash
$ echo "deb http://dl.bintray.com/gocd/gocd-deb/ /" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/gocd.list
$ wget --quiet -O - "https://bintray.com/user/downloadSubjectPublicKey?username=gocd" | sudo apt-key add -
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install go-server
```

Alternatively, if you have the server DEB downloaded -

```bash
$ sudo dpkg -i go-server-${version}.deb
```

## Managing the go-server service on linux

To manage the go-server service, you may use the following commands -

```bash
$ /etc/init.d/go-server [start|stop|status|restart]
```

Once the installation is complete the Go server will be started and it will print out the URL for the Dashboard page. This will be ```http://localhost:8153/go```

## Location of go server files

The go server installs the following files on your filesystem

```
/var/lib/go-server       #contains the binaries and database
/etc/go                  #contains the pipeline configuration files
/var/log/go-server       #contains the server logs
/usr/share/go-server     #contains the start script
/etc/default/go-server   #contains all the environment variables with default values. These variable values can be changed as per requirement.
```
